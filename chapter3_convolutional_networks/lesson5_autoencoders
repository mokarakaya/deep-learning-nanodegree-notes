Autoencoders:
Encoders and decoders are constructed by neural network to compress and decompress the data.
Autoencoders are also used for denoising.

A Simple Autoencoder:
Neural network is created as Input:748 length vectors, Hidden: N, Output: 748
Hidden layer vector are much smaller and has the compressed data.

Convolutional Autoencoders:
Encoder is several layers of convolution and max pooling layers respectively.
Decoder is sevetal layers of resize and convolutional layers respectively.
Resize creates a bigger picture and fills the gaps. We can use several methods to fill the gaps. For instance;
tf.image.resize_nearest_neighbor(convd, (14, 14)) -> creates a 14,14 data and predicts the gap by using nearest neigbors.

In the last step of both models we use optimizer e.g. AdamOptimizer
