Semi-Supervised Classification with GANS:
In previous examples our goal was to train generator. After we trained the model we only use the generator. So, generator has the first importance.
In semi-supervised classification, we train the discriminator as the classifer. In this models, discriminator has the first importance.

In this model, we create the classes and we add an extra class which is labeled as 'fake'.

Costs are ->
total_cost = cost_labeled + cost_unlabeled
cost_labeled = cross_entropy(logits, labels)
cost_unlabeled = cross_entropy(logits, real)
p_real = sum(softmax(real_classes))
