Polices:
Deterministic policy = π: S -> A (input is S, output is A, and π is the policy)
Stochastic policy = π: S x A -> [0, 1]
π(a | s) = P(A_t = a | S_t =s)
Environment s and action a is the input and returns an action while the agent is in state s.

Deterministic policy example -> π(low) = recharge or π(recharge | low) = 1 (since the probability is set to 1)
Stochastic policy example -> π(recharge | low) = 0.5 (Whenever the battery is low, recharge it with 0.5 probability)
