Policy-Based Methods:
So far, we have worked on value-based methods where we optimize value function and policies are implicitly optimized.
In this lesson, we'll try to optimize policies directly without using value functions.
In next lesson, we'll combine these two methods which is known as actor-critic methods.

Why Policy-Based Methods:
For simplicity, stochastic policies, and continuous action space.
