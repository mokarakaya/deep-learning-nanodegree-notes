Confusion Matrix:
The patient is sick and diagnosed as sick -> True positive
The patient is sick and diagnosed as healthy -> False negative
The patient is healthy and diagnosed as sick -> False positive
The patient is healthy and diagnosed as healthy -> True negatives

Precision:
Precision -> true positives / (true positives + false positives)

Recall:
Recall -> true positives / (true positives + false negatives)

ROC Curve:
We first calculate True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate pairs from different predictions.
True Positive Rate = True Positives / All Positives
False Positive Rate = False Positives / All Negatives

After we found all pairs (or enough), we plot them into x,y graph and calculate the area of the curve.
Area under the curve for Perfect Split is a square.
Area under the curve for Random Split is close to a triangle.
Area under the curve for Good Split is a curve.
